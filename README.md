# Captcha - Client example (React App)

This project needs [Captcha service](https://github.com/joeldrt/captcha-service) to work

This example will only work if you set your hosts files to point php-captcha.local to localhost like this.

```txt
127.0.0.1    php-docker.local
```

### To run:

```sh
npm start
```
